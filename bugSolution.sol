```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: _amount}('');
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
    require(address(this).balance == balanceBefore - _amount, "Transfer amount mismatch");
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _amount;
}
```

This corrected version uses `call{value: _amount}` for a more reliable transfer and includes additional checks to ensure the transfer was successful and the correct amount was deducted.
